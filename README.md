# KKBox-s-Churn-Prediction

Implementation of Machine learning algorithm using R.

1. Random Forest
2. Neural Networks
3. Logistic regression

Please download the data for KKBox's Churn Prediction Challenge competition from
the kaggle website:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge/data
For the training data, train.csv
1) How many features are numerical data? And how many are categorical data
2) Make histogram for the numerical features, to see how they distribute
3) Make table for the categorical features, to see how they distribute

Conduct 5-fold cross-validation to estimate the classification error.
Report the training and testing AUCs, respectively.
